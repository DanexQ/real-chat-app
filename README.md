Simple example of real chat app using Firebase, React with Typescript and Styled Components. My first bigger project. I learn a lot of new stuff here and solved too much errors that I wasn't aware of before. The last commit was 13 January 2023. I won't change anything in my code here because it's good to see how my skills changed. Check my other repositories ;). There is missing some of the features like sorting chats, creating grups and other that I wanted to do, because of focusing on other projects and school. Someday I will continue this app but with my today's knowledge.
